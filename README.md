# Automatic-Pong-Thrower

Many robots nowadays haven’t utilized the human ability to throw, launch, or toss. These actions are used by humans as a tool to extend reach for many possibilities and yet the majority of robots don’t have the same capabilities. Robotics with machine learning paired alongside launching capabilities has the ability to reach a higher level of preciseness compared to humans. This can be proven with a simple trial of making a robot accurately launch a ball into a cup at many different distances. This is done with polynomial regression, a spinning wheel, and cup tracking.
This code will help reduce the dead zone of general robotic arms, while increasing the overall available work envelope.
